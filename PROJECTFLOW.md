- **server.js**: Entry point of the Node.js server.

### Project Flow

1. **Frontend Flow:**

   - The `index.js` file in `src/` is the entry point which renders the `App` component.
   - `App.js` defines the main routes using React Router (`ProtectedRoute.js`, `PublicRoute.js`).
   - Components (`Header.js`, `Sidebar.js`, `Modal.js`, etc.) are composed in pages (`Login.js`, `Dashboard/Analytics.js`, etc.).
   - Data fetching and state management are handled using Redux (`redux/`) with actions (`authActions.js`, etc.) and slices (`authSlice.js`).
   - Services (`API.js`, `authService.js`) handle API requests to the backend.
   - CSS styles (`styles/`) are applied globally (`App.css`, `index.css`) and locally to components.

2. **Backend Flow:**
   - `server.js` sets up the Express server and connects to MongoDB using `db.js`.
   - Routes (`authRoutes.js`, `inventoryRoutes.js`, etc.) define API endpoints and call corresponding controllers (`authController.js`, `inventoryController.js`).
   - Controllers interact with models (`userModel.js`, `inventoryModel.js`) to perform CRUD operations.
   - Middleware (`authMiddleware.js`, etc.) handles authentication, authorization, and other request preprocessing.
   - Static assets (images, icons) are served from `public/` in the client.

### Database

- MongoDB is likely used as the database (configured in `db.js`).
- Models (`userModel.js`, `inventoryModel.js`) define the schema and methods for interacting with the database.

### Authentication

- Handled using JSON Web Tokens (JWT), likely implemented in `authMiddleware.js` and `authController.js`.
- Login (`Login.js`) and registration (`Register.js`) are implemented on the frontend.
- Protected routes (`ProtectedRoute.js`) ensure authenticated access.

### Redux

- Manages application state, including user authentication (`authSlice.js`).
- Actions (`authActions.js`) define methods for dispatching actions.
- Store configuration (`store.js`) sets up Redux store.

### API

- Axios (`API.js`) is used to make HTTP requests to the server.
- Backend endpoints (`authRoutes.js`, `inventoryRoutes.js`, etc.) define API routes and handle requests.

### Summary

This project follows a typical MERN stack architecture, where React is used for the frontend, Express and Node.js for the backend, MongoDB as the database, and Redux for state management. Each directory and file is structured to handle specific functionalities like authentication, routing, state management, and database operations, providing a scalable and maintainable application structure.
